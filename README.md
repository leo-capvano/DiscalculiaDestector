# DiscalculiaDestector

This application is a tool for supporting the clinician in the generation of responsive web-based tests for individuating people with disorder in basic numerical and arithmetic skills. 
Tests are created by combining specific kinds of questions which are delivered to a sample of people belonging to a specific target. The tool provides also support in the data analysis and in setting the alert thresholds for the selected user target. 

Results may be graphically visualized in summarized and single user way. Once the setting process is terminated, the test may be adopted. A case study on adult people is also presented.
